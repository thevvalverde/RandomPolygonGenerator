Best-Improvement:
for both the small and the big samples, fails about 50% of the time.

First-Improvement:
one of the most consistent for big samples, but fails with the same frequency for the small random.

LC:
fails about 30% of the time for small samples, and frequently runs out of memory for the big ones.

Random:
almost never fails, but also takes more time.

SA:
sometimes finds the results in 30 iterations, but then it moves to LC and follows the same pattern.
